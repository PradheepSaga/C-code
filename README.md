# C-code
Code Explanation

The program prompts the user to enter two integer values and then swaps these values using arithmetic operations. The swapped values are then displayed.
How it Works

    Input:
        The user is prompted to enter two integer values for variables a and b.

    Swapping Logic:
        The values of a and b are swapped using arithmetic operations:
            a = a + b
            b = a - b
            a = a - b

    Output:
        The program displays the values of a and b before and after swapping.
